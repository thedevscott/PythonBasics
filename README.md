# Python Basics

Here you will find several Python applications I have implemented on my journey
to increase my knowledge and skill with the Python Programming Language.

Visit https://github.com/talkpython/python-jumpstart-course-demos to learn 
more about the course I completed.

## Applications:
* File Searcher
* Real Estate Analysis
* Movie Search

## Setup
To run these apps do the following

* Make sure Python3 is installed on your system
    * Visit https://www.python.org/ to download and install Python
* Create a virtuealenv
    ```
    python -m virtualenv env
    ```
    * Optionally, visit https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/ for more details
* Run the install command for the 'requirements.txt' file
    ```
    pip install -r requiremets.txt
    ```
* Open the project using PyCharm and run the app
    
With that you should be all set. Enjoy
